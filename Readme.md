# Diamond Data Analysis CLI Application

This application is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for analyzing diamond data from a CSV file. The program provides several functionalities such as displaying all data, calculating average prices, finding the most expensive diamond, counting diamond colors, and more.

## Features

- **Display All Data**: Show the full content of the CSV file.
- **Calculate Average Price**: Compute the average price of all diamonds in the file.
- **Find Most Expensive Diamond**: Identify the diamond with the highest price.
- **Count Ideal Cut Diamonds**: Count the number of diamonds with an 'Ideal' cut.
- **Display Color Counts**: Show the count of each color of diamonds.
- **Calculate Median Carat**: Find the median carat weight of the diamonds.
- **Average Carat by Cut**: Calculate the average carat weight grouped by the cut type.
- **Average Price by Color**: Compute the average price of diamonds grouped by color.
- **Clear Terminal**: Clear the terminal screen.
- **Exit**: Exit the application.

## Installation
